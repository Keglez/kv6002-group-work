This page will include events. It will display in order of date added, and can be filtered a search box and a dropdown menu. If you wish to see the authenticated navbar for your own development, uncomment it on line 15 of `resources/js/Pages/Home.jsx` in the project folder and comment out line 14. One last thing, you can update the colours in your css components to the colours found in the `tailwind.config.js` file. All colours are formatted similar to `bg-colourname` so you can just use the find tool to go through and change them to what you wish. Any questions can be posted in the discord and I will be happy to answer. Happy egineering!"})]})]}),e.jsx(n,{})]})})}export{c as default};
