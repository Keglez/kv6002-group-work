This project is the group work for the KV6002 module - Team Project and Professionalism.

**Challenge Area:** 
Event Managment System Prototype

**Project Description:**
Our challenge area for this project was to build an even management system prototype. We employed Laravel for backend, React for frontend, and MongoDB for collections. While the prototype is not perfect and given the couple of week time restriction and small team, we weren't able to make everything fully functional and would need to be refractored for security purposes. However, this project demonstrates the implementation using a tech stack for real-world use.
